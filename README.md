4. To run the application in development mode, use:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## Firebase Configuration

The application uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore as the database. Ensure your Firebase project is set up and configured correctly. The configuration is loaded from environment variables for security.

Hereâ€™s a snippet of how Firebase is initialized:
    ```bash
    import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
    import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
    import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

    const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
        authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
        projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
        storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
        messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
        appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
        measurementId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID,
    };

    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    const auth = getAuth(app);
    const firestore = getFirestore(app);
